    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Idlies are a beloved South Indian delicacy, cherished for their soft, fluffy texture and subtle, tangy flavor. Made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (split black gram), these steamed rice cakes are not only light and healthy but also packed with nutrients. They are gluten-free, low in calories, and a great source of protein, making them a perfect breakfast option for all age groups. The fermentation process enhances the batter's nutrient profile and contributes to gut health, adding a probiotic boost to your diet. </p>
    <p> Typically served with an array of accompaniments like coconut chutney, tangy sambar, or spicy podi (a flavorful lentil-based powder), idlies are versatile and easy to pair with a variety of sides. Whether you're enjoying them as a wholesome start to your day or a comforting snack, idlies showcase the simplicity and richness of traditional Indian cuisine.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Idly Rice - 2 cups</li>
        <li>Urad Dal (Split Black Gram) - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Fenugreek Seeds - 1 teaspoon (optional, for enhanced fermentation)</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Water - as needed </li>
    </ul>
<br>
<h2> Recipe</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Wash and soak the idli rice and fenugreek seeds together in a large bowl for 6–8 hours.</li>
    <li>Wash and soak the urad dal in a separate bowl for 4–6 hours. </li>
    <li>Drain the soaked urad dal and grind it into a smooth, fluffy batter using a wet grinder or blender. Add water gradually to achieve a light and airy texture. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Combine the rice batter with the urad dal batter, and add salt to taste. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8–12 hours (or overnight). The batter should rise and become airy. Fermentation time may vary based on the climate.</li>
    <li>Grease idli molds with a little oil or ghee. Pour the batter into the molds, filling each compartment about ¾ full.</li>
    <li>Steam the idlis in an idli steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle) for 10–15 minutes on medium heat.</li>
    <li>To check if the idlis are done, insert a toothpick or knife into the center; it should come out clean.</li>
    <li>Gently remove the idlis from the molds using a spoon. Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or idli podi for a complete South Indian experience.</li>
</ol>
